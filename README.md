## Sprints

### Sprint 1
The goal of this sprint was to solidify our decision on choosing Unity. We focused on learning multiple aspects of Unity to prepare to develop the game. This involved watching various YouTube videos and reading many tutorials before we got started. Besides this, we tried to create the basic structure of the game so we knew who was working on which parts of the code and how they would eventually integrate.

### Sprint 2
The goal of this sprint was to combine our individual work to demonstrate starting the game. 
Integrating player movement into the UI in place was crucial.
