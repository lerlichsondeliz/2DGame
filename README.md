# 2DGame


# Overview
Overgrown is a 2D top-down game created in Unity. It is a two-player Co-op game in which the players fight radioactive enemies that do a significant amount of damage when they get too close to either player. The players share a health bar, so be careful. If one of you guys is taking a lot of damage, you will most likely fail to make it to the next wave. 

# Features
- Players can switch between using a sword or a hammer depending how they would like to attack the enemies that come after them. 
- The first wave of enemies will be very simple and should serve as a way to introduce players to the base mechanics of the game, but once you beat the original wave, good luck because it will definitely get more challenging. 
- Both players work simultaneously on a level by using the keys on a keyboard. One player uses wasd and the other uses ijkl.
- If players don't like sound, they can mute the game.
- Custom Animations of sprites(Developed by Erin)
- Enemies are drawn to a player and automatically follow the player based on position.
- Homepage to direct players to the actual combat or other preferences like options to see controls.

The goal of this sprint was to combine our individual work to demonstrate starting the game. 
Integrating player movement into the UI in place was crucial.
